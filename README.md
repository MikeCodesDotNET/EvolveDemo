This app demonstrates custom tableviews and a simple login view using Gravatar & Zendesk. 

This project is built using Xamarin.Mac and uses the Classic API. You will require a copy of Xamarin.Mac in order to build this. (Trials are available if you're not already a license holder').

####NSWindow Wobble (The shaker)
Using a KeyFrame Animation, you can shake controls on your screen. Mostly used to alert users to incorrect login creditals / failed signin attemps.

####ZendeskApi_V2
This is an awesome library by Eric Neifert that allows for interaction with the Zendesk restful service. If you're using Zendesk then I highly recommend this library!
